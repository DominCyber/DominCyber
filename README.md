### Hi, I'm Manuel

I am a senior intelligence analyst with 16 years of intelligence analysis experience. Additionally, I have 9 years of IT experience as a database manager. Overall, my background consists of serving in both the United States Navy and the Intelligence Community. I am continuing my defense oriented-career into the cybersecurity realm, determined to myself a more well-rounded security professional. 

Additionally, I want to pursue my fascination in technical nuances; I see a parallel between threat signal analysis and cyber threat analysis.

## Objective

My journey in the defense intelligence and technology fields has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to become a cybersecurity analyst.
